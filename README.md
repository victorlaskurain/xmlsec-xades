# Xades signature with bash, openssl and xmlsec

sign_xml adds an enveloped Xades signature to the xml document provided in its standar input stream. Just add a `$SIGNATURE` placeholder to tell sign_xml where to add the Signature block.

Check `time_run` for a simple example of how to use the script.
